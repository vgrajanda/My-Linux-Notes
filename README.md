## Welcome to my linux notes

Greetings traveler, I'm not used to writing articles like this, so, this is my first one. Here I will share all my knowledge, all related to Linux, scripting in general, tips and tricks and things that I want to remember in the future.

I hope these notes can be used by anyone and be helpful to you; I really do :)

## WARNING

I'm not an English native speaker, so if you find a grammar error pls let me know now and i will fix it right the way. I will appreciate your comments :)

## Who is this article for?

For anyone who is searching for something specific and I write about it already. I will always try to cover the most basic things to the more advanced. I don't know how much I will be covering in this kind of guide, but my goal is to make it as complete as possible.
